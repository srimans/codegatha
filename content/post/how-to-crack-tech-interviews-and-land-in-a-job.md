This post is all about the tips and tricks about cracking tech interviews. This is not at all a technical post. Nothing technical here but I myself have been in the situation where I was forced to look for jobs due to some unwanted situations and there I learned how to get a job. This post is meant for all who are looking to crack interviews and hence get a job. Here it goesâ€¦..

### Confidence
It is and hence it is the most important thing that is required to make you land in a perfect job. Confidence and over confidence go hand in hand. People tend to become over confident and hence lose the chance they should have got. A way of staying confident is by talking to yourself,killing the nervousness and saying
`````
YES I CAN DO IT !!!
`````
Yes you have all the qualities and that is the reason why you have been selected for the interview. Why can you not do it?!!

### Positivity
Remove all the negative thoughts from your mind. People tend to think what will happen during the interview?!! What if something bad will happen?!!
`````
GO TO THE INTERVIEW WITH A CLEAR MIND
`````
Just chill out!! Listen to some cool music or think about something else. Just calm down. Alas a nervy feeling cannot take you forward. As far as I know negative thoughts are more harmful than anything else. Always be positive.

### Preparation
It says how good you are in your field where you are going to work. If you are looking for jobs in a highly competitive area then preparation matters a lot. Learn the concepts and theories of your work related area properly. Read books, search from the internet and prepare yourself well.
`````
HARD WORK IS THE KEY TO SUCCESS
`````

### Luck
I have seen cases where people get jobs by sheer luck. But mostly luck is all your hard work. If you are prepared well enough then luck will be after you.
`````
LUCK IS ONLY A MATTER OF PREPARATION MEETING OPPORTUNITY
`````

### Patience
Never be tired. Never take rest. Always work hard. Keep yourself focussed. Keep yourself motivated. Keep the confidence in you going strong.
`````
EVERY DOG HAS A DAY
`````
Itâ€™s an old saying but it is true. One day will come when it will be all yours. When all these 4 points above meet then nobody can beat you on that day. Keep working hard by learning new things. Keep the desire of learning within you burning.


So have patience. Our 5 fingers are not same so everything you want will happen in someday or the other. Always remember that everything happens for good only. Keep the positivity within you flowing. Keep learning and keep exploring ðŸ™‚

Aim of this post was to build confidence. I am a full stack software engineer working on .NET technology. In my next post I will be focussing primarily on my domain and concrete questions that are asked in the tech interviews.
